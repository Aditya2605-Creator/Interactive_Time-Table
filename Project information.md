In modern educational institutions, students and faculty members often face challenges in efficiently accessing academic schedules, faculty information, and course-specific details. Traditional methods, such as printed timetables or static digital files, lack interactivity and seamless navigation, making it cumbersome for users to find and manage relevant information.
This project was developed with the aim of solving these challenges by providing an interactive, web-based timetable system that allows smooth navigation between the overall schedule and subject-specific details. By integrating clickable subject links, student lists, faculty details, and a real-time clock, this project ensures better accessibility, efficiency, and ease of use in managing academic activities.
